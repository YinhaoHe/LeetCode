Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

Given an integer array of size n, find the maximum of the minimumâ€™s of every window size in the array. Note that window size varies from 1 to n.
